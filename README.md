# POPTREE: A PROOF OF PLANT FOR REFORESTATION

Poptree is a MVP designed to help any actor prove that they planted a tree at a specific time and place.

This first iteration is a primitive implementation of Proof Of Plant (POP), it involves three actors: 
* 1 Those who plant trees (seeders)
* 2 Those who validate that a tree has indeed been planted and grown to be 6 months old (validators)
* 3 Those who finance the whole process by purchasing POP tokens (greenvesters).

## POP workflow:

* 1 Seeder starts the process by uploading a picture of herself on the intended seeding site, along with the GPS coordinates of the place where she intends to seed. In return, user receives a hash as a receipt of her commit. 
* 2 On the intended planting location, user leaves a 50x100 centimeter sign reading the hash receipt of their Proof Of Plant (POP). 
* 3 6 months later, user uploads a picture of herself holding a sign in front of the tree(s) she planted.
* 4 Validator reviews the submitted POP and verify the submitted pictures (before/after), and if available, satellite pictures of the location.
* 5 If the POP is validated, Seeder receives a fixed amount of POP tokens.
* 6 Validator receives a fixed amount of POP tokens, regardless if they rejected or accepted the POP submission.


pop can be one or several plants


## Roadmap
* Maintenance of existing trees by with by-annual POC (Proof Of Care)
* Project integration in a Carbon Credit Market
* Addition of a Proof of Presence to the existing POP
* Integration to the Gas Station Network
